/// This will strip the seal digest, and confirm that only a single such digest exists.

/// executive as it is run on the parachain itself.
/// (Aspitational) Finally it puts the original digest back on and confirms the blocks match
///
/// Essentially this contains the logic of the verifier and the normal executive.
/// TODO Degisn improvement:
/// Can we share code with the verifier?
/// Can this struct take a verifier as an associated type?
/// Or maybe this will just get simpler ingeneral when https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/2888 lands
